# React Native TypeScript Sample

This is a small sample project showcasing my React Native development style with **TypeScript**, **React Navigation**, **Context API** for state management, and **Jest** for testing.  

It demonstrates clean code practices, type safety, and a simple app architecture that can be scaled to larger projects.

---

## Features
- ✅ Type-safe navigation using **React Navigation v6**
- ✅ Global state management with **Context + useReducer**
- ✅ Simple example of adding/removing favorites
- ✅ Unit test setup with **Jest** and **React Testing Library**
- ✅ Cross-platform UI (iOS & Android)
